    <h1>The Common Hall Village 20 Community</h1>
	<p>Thanks for coming here to learn more about how you can become a part of our newest OZET performance, <em>Common Hall Village 20</em>.</p>
	<p>Below you'll find all the details about what we're doing and what part we'd like you to have in it.  Hopefully, you'll be curious enough to read through them, and adventurous enough join us.  We're really excited about the show and would love to have you involved.</p>
	<p>If you know you would like to be part of the &quot;community&quot;, or if you have any questions we couldn't answer here, email scott@ozet.us or aaron@ozet.us.</p>
	<h2>A little background, if you don't know about OZET yet:</h2>
	<p>OZET is an ongoing collaboration between Aaron Meicht and Scott Blumenthal that encompasses a variety of live performances, films, recordings, and a band.  Each piece of the project draws on and expands the fictional history of the Collective Sphere OZET: an enormous spacecraft, created by an alternate-past Soviet empire to be home to several hundred <em>lishenets</em> (politically disenfranchised enemies of the people), euphemistically called &quot;Pioneers.&quot;</p>
	<h2>And this is how we're describing the new piece, CHV20:</h2>
	<p>On the eve of the Festival of the Fifteenth Generation, the Pioneers of Village 20 gather to watch The Council’s official broadcast.  The vodka is free, the band plays anthems and local favorites, and the villagers wonder, “Will the soil recover?  Are the men in the corner really here to help?”  Before the celebration ends, a shocking interruption will expose a fissure in the OZET’s Utopian facade, and the Pioneers will face the beginning of a new, troubled age.</p>
	<h2>Where do you come in?</h2>
	<p>All along we have brought together unlikely combinations of performers from across many disciplines, and experimented with fostering nontraditional relationships between the performers and the audience.  This time, we are pushing the idea even further: CHV20 portrays a slice of OZET village life, and the vivid experience of gathering together in a bar with both strangers and friends.  For two weeks, then, we want to create a real but temporary community that comes together to celebrate and drink and make music, and to give the regular audience a truer sense of the life of this moment on the OZET.</p>
	<p>We are not asking to you to be a &quot;performer.&quot;  You won't have to act and you certainly don't need prior performing experience.  The approach we're taking comes out of a long tradition of &quot;task-driven&quot; pieces, employed particularly by the experimental music community, but also by the world of dance, performance art, and theater.</p>
	<h2>Here is what we’re asking you to do:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You must commit to attending <strong>one evening rehearsal</strong> that will be held sometime between January 12 and 21.  (We will try to schedule two rehearsals, so you can pick the more convenient one, and we'll nail down the dates and locations as soon as possible so you can plan around it.)  During the rehearsal we'll walk you through the shape of the performance, teach you some songs, and explain how, on the nights you attend, you as an individual will become part of the action.</li>
		<li>You must commit to participating in at least <strong>TWO performances</strong> of Common Hall Village 20.  (We'd love it if you joined us for more, and you’re welcome to be there every night if you want, but you’re still a full citizen of the piece if you can only do two.)  Performances are on the following dates: January 26, 27, 28, 29, and Febraury 2, 3, 4, 5.  All performances are at 8pm at St. Mark's Church on the corner of 10th St and 2nd Ave, in Manhattan.  We expect the show to be less than two hours long.</li>
		<li>At the performance, each participant will be given a set of basic actions to perform.  These will guide your movement in the space, give you rules for interacting with other participants, and dictate how you participate (or don't) in the larger events taking place throughout the evening (listening to the festival speeches, toasting the Fifteenth Generation, singing along with the official and local songs).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>That's pretty much it.  We're not offering to pay participants; we hope you'll join us because the idea sounds fun and exciting to you.  (As another perk, we welcome you to drink your fill of free vodka during the show.)  Unfortunately, we can't offer you complementary tickets for your friends to come see you, but we do hope you'll invite them to come anyway.</p>
	<p>If you want to join us, or have any questions please email scott@ozet.us or aaron@ozet.us.</p>
	<p>SERVE IN SPACE!</p>
