	<p class="directions">The following conversations are pre-recorded and played in the space during the opening of the show.  They are intended to be remixed into something more impressionistic.</p>
	
	<h4>Two men</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Which one?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Her.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Really?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>She looks like she doesn't wash.  I like that.  I haven't gotten close enough to smell her though.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You're disgusting.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Maybe she'll let herself get drunk, because of the festival and all.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p> Maybe if someone brought her a drink.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Yeah.  No one is going near her.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Gives you a chance in hell anyway.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>A farmer</h4>
	
	<cite>Farmer</cite>
	<p>I love the harvest.  I was the Hero of Threshing for the village last year. I brought in twelve hundred bushels of corn.  Now the corn dies overnight.  I see it withering.  I race to the thresher.  I drive and drive but I can't save the harvest.</p>
	<p>We did everything right.  We plow.  We disk, we harrow.  Spring tooth and spike tooth.</p>
	<p>We fertilize.  Look out there.  Beautiful fields.</p>
	<p>It's like losing a baby.  You have hopes.  You wait.  And suddenly, it's gone.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>Two villagers</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Goats in the schoolroom.	Goat shit on the floor.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>The police pulled up the pasture fences and put them across the road out of the village.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Why?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>And guards.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Through the night.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Who would leave?</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>A woman</h4>
	
	<cite>Woman</cite>
	
	<p>As if she owns it.  As if it's hers.  Locks the door when she goes out.  Never leaves anyone else in charge for a minute.  Sleeps here.  Up there.  Not always alone.  No.  Locks the door during the day too when she's here, sometimes, especially when she's got a visitor.  Counts the bottles.  She has more stock than she lets on.  She tried to raise the price of vodka once and said the Council set the cost.  But Torgva spent the night in Village 12 and paid less there for his drink.  He came back and told her to her face.  Called her a liar.  She blamed the price on the man who delivers the vodka.  She said the distributor had to pay the distiller more last time because the distiller said the Council raised the price of potatoes.  So she wasn't lying, she says to Torgva, just simplifying.  But who knows if that part is even true.  I don't believe her.  She has too many stories.  Now watch.  Now that we can't leave the village, she'll raise the price again and who will be able say it's different in Village 12?</p>

	<h4>A villager</h4>
	
	<cite>Villager</cite>
	<p>A child in Village 1 will be the last. A child in Village 4 will be the first.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>Two men</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Come here.  Come over here.  Why are you walking by?  I know you saw me.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>I didn't see you.</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Yes you did.  As you came in the door.</p>

	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>I didn't see you, Uta.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You don't even come in to meals at the same time as you used to.  Why are you avoiding me?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Uta.  I'm not.  It's good to see you.</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Oh, it's good to see you too.  So why don't you sit down?</p>

	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>I told Levan I'd join him.</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>He'll be here all night.  Sit down and tell me what you have to say for yourself.</p>

	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>What do you mean?</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Well, Niko said you're talking about me.  Said you were planning to go to the council with some complaints.</p>

	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>You should know better than to listen to him.  Good to see you, Uta.</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>What did I do to you?  Heh?  What did I do?  Son of a bitch.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>The two from the city</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Why did I have to end up here.  Couldn't they send us to our own villages?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Think about it.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>I hate Village 20.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>They probably think we'd spill the beans.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>What do you mean?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>If you were back in the village where you were raised, you would probably think: I should tell these people the truth.  Old Petre there, he taught me how to carve a boat out of brick of soap. He deserves to know what is really happening.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>And what is happening?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>You know what I mean.  You might tell people about the other villages.  You might tell them...</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>OK.  Quiet.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>It's better this way.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>For everyone but us.  I can't even sit down to breakfast with these people.  How can you stand it?  Watching them with their pickled eggs.  I grew up with a dish of yogurt in the morning.  And to smell the eggs on their breath all day long.  It's unbearable.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>You'll be back in the city soon enough.  You can have all the yogurt you want.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>Torgva and Irma</h4>
	
	<cite>IRMA:</cite>
	<p>Torgva.  Come here.  What is this?  Tea?  On the Festival night?  And no work tomorrow!</p>
	
	<cite>TORGVA:</cite>
	<p>I don't like getting drunk.</p>
	
	<cite>IRMA:</cite>
	<p>This will be your last festival, Torgva.  Twenty years from now we'll both be dead.  Try the vodka flavored with celery.  It's not so strong that way.</p>
	
	<cite>TORGVA:</cite>
	<p>I'm fine without it, darling.</p>
	
	<cite>IRMA:</cite>
	<p>All right.  But I'm not giving up on you.  You aren't dead yet.</p>
	
	<cite>TORGVA:</cite>
	<p>No.  Not yet.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>A Man</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>What do they say?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>The scientists?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Of course.  What do they think caused this?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>They won't say for sure.  They think it's probably some kind of infection.  Something that went into the seeds.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>But they don't think there is something wrong with the soil?  Or the water?  It doesn't make any sense.  If the problem was seeds, then why did the corn sprout at all?  Why did corn stalks grow three feet then suddenly rot where they stood?  And why have the trees lost their leaves?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Go and ask them.  They are right over there.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Maybe I will.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>They won't say what they've found.  I think it is something bad.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>That's what I'm telling you.  That's why we need to know.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>A villager (A) and a scientist from the city (B)</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You are... Your name. What is it?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Kokhta.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Cousin Kokhta.  You're almost done with your vodka.  I'll bring you another.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>No thank you, Cousin.  I'll just sip this one for a while.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>When you finish this one then.  The vodka is free tonight.  I'm not trying to bribe you.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Of course not.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You've heard that in Village Twenty you should be on your guard?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>No.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite> 
	<p>What is our reputation, would you say?  In the city?  What does the Council think of us?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>I wouldn't know.  I report to them, not them to me.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Don't they give you a dossier?  A list of troublemakers, maybe?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Nothing like that at all.  What about you?  Maybe you've been taught not to like people from the city?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Don't have to be taught.  I don't like you just from talking to you.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Give me some time.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Why don't you and your friend come and sit with us?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Who is us?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Sula.  Drives a tractor.  Zviad, with the moustache.  Uta, teaches in the school.</p>
	 
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>What does Zviad do?</p>

	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>He's here most of the day.  Injured his leg so he's not working right now.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>What happened?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>He was swimming in the river and his leg got pulled into a filter.  Broke the bone clean in two.  You don't believe me?  You've heard that they're lazy in Village Twenty.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>I've heard it said.  Don't put much stock in it.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Our numbers are lower than the other villages.  Have been for generations.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Is that because you are all lazy?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>We got a bad patch of soil.  The air is deader here.  The solder joints in our irrigation system weren't done right and we have breakdowns.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Those reasons are harder to believe than the rumors of laziness.</p>
		
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Yeah, well who has lived here for forty-four years?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Then you don't have anything to compare Village Twenty to, do you?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>I spent almost a year training in Village Two.  It's much nicer than this shithole.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>According to the council, there are no differences between the Villages.  All have comparable resources.  All have comparable structures.  All have diversified populations.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>See how you feel after another month here.  You may start to change.  You may develop a stronger thirst for vodka.  You may start taking bribes.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Though you aren't offering one.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>I'm offering you a place at a table with your neighbors.  I'm offering to reserve my judgement of you.  Things I might offer any man.  Whether you call those things a bribe really has more to do with what those offers mean to you.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>A woman</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>He told me he had a dream about me.  We were in the City.  Not together at first.  He said he was in the City.  He was supposed to meet with the superintendent of something.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Where do you come in?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>I'm getting to that.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Get to it now.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You don't like him.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>No, I don't.  He wants you to fall in love with him.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>So?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Do you think he's in love with you?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>He might be.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Fine. Get back to the dream.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>You don't think he could be in love with me?</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Would you choose him if he was?  And live apart from us?  Petition for a child?</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>I never said anything about that.  I'm not so old fashioned, Xatia.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Listening to a man's dreams is old fashioned.</p>
	
	<!------------------->
	
	<h4>Two Men</h4>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Listen to what I'm telling you: they don't think like we do.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>The law serves the people.  The councilors serve the law.</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>At fifteen, the future councilors are plucked from the villages and they go to the city.</p>
	
	<cite>B:</cite>
	<p>Yes.  For fifteen years they live just like...</p>
	
	<cite>A:</cite>
	<p>Let me finish.  They go to the city.  It consumes them.  An OZET within OZET.  That's what I've heard.  The City is its own world.  An OZET within OZET.</p>
