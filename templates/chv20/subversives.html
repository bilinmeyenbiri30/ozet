	<p class="directions">As the song is drawing toward its end, the sound of the official festival broadcast (which has continued on the televisions and the speakers) is taken over a few speakers at a time by something new.  Then, when the sound has been completely hijacked, the official broadcast on the televisions is suddenly replaced by the image of a group of SUBVERSIVES.  Their identities are somehow obscured, by the clothes they are wearing, or by some trick of the video feed.  Neither is it clear from where they are broadcasting: it may be from several different locations.  The image flickers between different faces, but for the first part of the interruption, one subversive seems to be speaking for all of them.</p>

	<p>Cousins.  Your attention.  We don't have much time.</p>

	<p>We are your neighbors. Each of you knows one of us.  This you have to believe.  We are not hiding our faces from you, but from the Council and the police, to buy ourselves just a little more time.  When our names are discovered we will be found, and we will punished for telling you the truth.</p>

	<p>Tonight, as you try to celebrate, each of you is wondering why misfortune has singled out your village.  You ask why tomorrow your stomach will not be full, when in every other village, your cousins will be feasting.  You look at the farmer next to you, staring into his drink, and you wonder if it is some carelessness on his part that caused the crops to fail.  Did he do this?  Is it because of him that the scientists and representatives of the Council came to your village and penned you in like goats?</p>

	<p>We are here to tell you, Cousins, that it is not his fault.  None of this is your fault, and you are not alone in your trouble.  In every village, the same thing is happening: the same failures, the same blights, the same hunger, and from the Council, the same response.  Not a village has been spared.  Every gate is closed, every Pioneer a prisoner.</p>

	<p>For the good of OZET, they said, stay at home.  Do not spread the news.  There will be a panic, and for what?  We are here, and we will help, they said.  But the months have drawn on.  And in each village, one or two of your cousins said, "Why should we not turn to each other for help?"  So they slipped past the guards, they stayed off the roads, and they found each other and together found out the truth.</p>
	
	<p class="directions">The faces of other subversives compete for the screen. Their voices start to simultaneously come out of different channels around the common hall.</p>

				<p>Now that we have shared the truth with you, the Council will try to isolate you from each other even more.  Believe us.  They will tell you it is for your safety.  They will demand thanks for the freedom you once had.  Thank them instead for taking it away.  It is only now that you understand how small that pasture of freedom really was that you grazed in.  Now you can begin to see the vast landscape of freedom in which you might roam.</p>

				<p>You will hear more from us.  Even when we are captured, we have confederates who will carry on the work.  There are lines of communication that they will not be able to break.</p>

				<p>Do not be still.  Do not be silent.  Let the council lose its voice instead.  There are words to be spoken and words to be sung.</p>

				<p>Let me tell you what I saw:</p>

				<p>I like to take a walk at the end of the day.  Along the far edge of the fields, where they meet the forest.  I was kicking a clod along, looking at my feet when I heard a crumpling sound. Chittering in the air.</p>

				<p>I looked up and covered my face.</p>

				<p>On earth there were plagues of insects.  Storm clouds of two inch long bugs, like little black gun barrels, with thorns on their legs and jaws like tin shears; they would come out of a clear sky and strip hundreds of hectares clean of crops.  The old Jewish books say God sent bugs to punish his enemies.</p>

				<p>But there were no bugs.  The treetops had turned brown overnight, and brown leaves were coming sideways toward me in clouds, landing on my forearm and in my hair.</p>

				<p>I told the Mayor.  He notified the Council.  The representatives arrived the next day.  The junior ministers and the police.  The scientists, they came later.  That was the beginning, when we couldn't move any more.</p>

				<p>We could have stopped this.  I was watching the signs.  I can tell you now.  You should have been paying attention, but you weren't.  When they changed the quotas.  When they tinkered with the clocks.  They took a minute here...  A minute, another minute.  Put one back at the end of the week.  Moved them around.  Daylight...  I was watching and I wrote it all down.  There's proof.  Buried in a box.  I have the dates and times and who said what.  The ones who spoke at the local council meetings.  I know who sided with the Grand Council, and I can prove to you that they were bought and controlled.  Each one.  With bottles of vodka.  With new linens.  They bought women for coffee and positions of influence.  Then there were the cousins that they took to the city, to special rooms where they kept them awake, and when the cousins came back they stood up for the quotas and the appointments and the new calendars.  The little changes...  You weren't worried.  You didn't think they mattered.  You let them go.  The ones who speak up, you thought, they must know a thing or two.  But you can't hear the things they cannot say!</p>

				<p>I've been watching for years and now the cat's out of the bag.  The Council will answer to the people!</p>
