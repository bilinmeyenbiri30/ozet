		<p>Look around the room for people without drinks.  When you see one, approach him and tell him you are going to buy him a drink.  Go to the bar and tell the bartender you are buying a drink for your friend, and you'll have another too.  Bring "your friend" the drink, raise your glass to him, and drink.</p>
		<p>Repeat this until the festival broadcast begins.</p>

		<p>You have misplaced your hat.  Look around the common hall for it until you find it.  If the broadcast begins and you still have not found it, continue looking but only in the transitions between sections.  Otherwise, sit still watch from wherever you are in your search.</p>
