	<p class="directions">As DZIDZIA is winding down her speech, and the villagers toast and drink, the NIKOLOZ, the band leader, jumps up to the stage and tells the band to start playing. He leads the villagers in a call and response to whip them up before sings.  (Note to DB: you can improv the calls if you want.)</p>

	<p>They'll be born on that river who make it across<br>
	for that river's eight childhoods wide<br>
	And the first that are born will be old on the day<br>
	they arrive on the opposite side<br>
	They'll be old on the opposite side.</p>
	
	<p>No one here now will get there, our bodies are left<br>
	where they fall on this path they have trod<br>
	We end floating in space like a trail of old bread<br>
	leading back to the home where we starved<br>
	Far away from the home where we starved.</p>
	
	<p>Though I won't get to see it, that river of stars<br>
	and I've never known freedom before<br>
	It is said the OZET on that day will be ours<br>
	When my children arrive on that shore<br>
	When my children arrive on that shore.</p>
